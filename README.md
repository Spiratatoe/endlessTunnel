# Space Surfers
the goal was to create a type of endless tunnel game in unity 3d engine
it should be different from the popular approach like temple run and subway surfers in the way that it allows all direction movement 

speaking of which here are the controls:

There a multiple types of Obstacles:
robots are unkillable by lasers and deal 5 dmg
asteroids are breakable by lasers and deal 1 hp, but hit them fast enough and you'll fly off course!

There are 2 types of score systems :
1 - distance x score multiplier => score
2 - collectables X ptsMultiplier => points

try your best to see how much you can collect, but be ware 
for every point you get, the faster the ship goes 

The difficulty adds on the it, has the multiplier is higher, the higher the difficulty 

Pretty much all the 3d models were taken from the Unity 3d store :
